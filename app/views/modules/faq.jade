                p Are there any rules?
            div.answer
                p #1 You must use free or open source components for your project and #2 by Friday 12.00am you must show a working prototype. It is expected but not mandatory that your project is released as open source shortly after the PIWEEK ends.

                    The team as a collective author.
                    If you are proposing a project make sure the legal terms are clear from the beginning and if you are joining another's project, you have to abide to its rules.
                    If participants or companies wish to keep control of the end result, it is OK as long as they clearly state it beforehand.
                    95% of the project are born with a free or open source license in mind. For the remaining 5%, each case must be considered alone.

                p Can I participate part-time?
            div.answer
                p While the ΠWEEK was born as a full-time endeavour, it's acceptable to join it part-time. Just be sure everyone knows that so you correctly manage expectations.

                p As a company, do I have to fully commit to the ΠWEEK?
            div.answer
                p No. Although Kaleidos will always devote 100% of its employees, your company doesn't need to. There is no minimum percentage to what a company is required to join the ΠWEEK.

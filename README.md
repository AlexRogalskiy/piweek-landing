Front Quarks
============

**Front-end playground for better code reuse, optimization, documentation and development-speed.**
Based on the OOCSS paradigm the aim of this repository is to investigate the best way to accomplish:

- Front-end reusable code
- Test and achieve a easy way to gain code mantainability in large teams
- Speed Up development process in long projects
- Provide a simple way to document visual code

Why Quarks?
------------

According to Wikipedia:
> A quark (/ˈkwɔrk/ or /ˈkwɑrk/) is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter.

Since the beggining of times, front-end code has suffered a major lack of interest by developers and the code regarding visual side of the websites has been often made by non-experts. **Wich lead us to unmaintainable amount of code non reusable and hard to understand. **

The idea behind the project is **to find the best way to keep front-end code organizated in small reusable pieces of code that can be inserted into major HTML or CSS files to create a major structure but keeping code always clean and optimizated**.

Both, HTML and CSS **sholud be assembled (as we do with other development languages) in the minimal technically functional piece possible** and documented to keep code always understandable and mantainable.

It also will help to non-experts to develop front-end code without bothering for common problems (like non-compliant HTML) using this code particles instead of developing their own semi-functional structures
